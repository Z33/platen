# Cyberpunk 2077

Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure story set in Night City, a megalopolis obsessed with power, glamour and body modification. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality. You can customize your characterâ€™s cyberware, skillset and playstyle, and explore a vast city where the choices you make shape the story and the world around you.
