Iron, Flax, and Bone are the three characterstics Pentolans themselves use to describe innate qualities about each other:

> In Pentola, iron is both rare and precious as it has apparent metamagical and demon-abjuring properties; any magic effects are more potent when iron is incorporated in the application and demons of all sorts shy away from iron as it ignores their abilities and defenses.
> **Iron** represents a characterâ€™s force of will, presence, and metaphysical aptitude.
